# shell-scripts
This repo contains a few shell scripts I wrote to make development a little easier.  Most of these are focused on Android development.

## Setup instructions
Before using the scripts in this repo, define an environment variable that points to the directory that stores these scripts.  For example:
```
export SHELL_SCRIPTS_HOME=/Users/tparsons/dev/git/shell-scripts
```
