# shell-scripts
This repo contains shell scripts that I use primarily for Android development.

This repo was originally forked from mitsnosrap's shell-scripts repo, which primarily contains wrappers around functionality ADB provides that know how to detect when multiple devices or emulators are running and prompt users for which device to use.

## Setup instructions
Before using the scripts in this repo, define an environment variable that points to the directory that stores these scripts.  For example:
```
export SHELL_SCRIPTS_HOME=/Users/backer/github/shell-scripts
```
